# Coil-Winding-Machine

Coil winding machine software for custom axiel flux motor manufacturing. The full machine will have a simple LCD screen GUI to enter neccesarry sizing values for the machine to use. One linear actuating stepper motor will move a rotary stepper motor back and forth as it spins coil around a custom-sized motor's bobbin.


## Motors

**NEMA17_linear** is the folder for the horizontal (linear) actuation stepper motor. 
  - This motor with move the *NEMA23_rotary* motor as it spins coils.
   
**NEMA23_rotary** is the folder for the coil spinning stepper motor.
